        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>When I was a freshman in High School, my computer tech teacher introduced me to basic web development.  My favorite part about it was that I could create out simple websites using only the basic notepad program that all Windows computers have installed.  I spent hours messing around with HTML and CSS, making websites that looked like they were designed by a toddler.  I loved every second of it.
        <br><br>
        Later in life, I decided that I wanted a more advanced understanding of web development and pursued a college degree.  Although my academic focus was on Information Technology, I gravitated more toward the web development side of the cirriculum.
        <br><br>
        After finishing college, I landed a job as a Tier 1 Technical Support Agent at <a href="https://www.dealerspike.com" target="_blank">Dealer Spike LLC.</a>, utilizing the web development skills I learned at Portland Community College.  After a year at that position, I was promoted to a Tier 2 agent.  My time at Dealer Spike has been absolutely amazing and has helped polish my web development skills.

                  <h4>What is HTML?</h4>
                  <p>
                    The HyperText Markup Language, or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.
                      <br><br>
                    Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.

                  <p>
                    HTML is a language that I use daily, within my current role at Dealer Spike.  I am highly proficient with HTML and can use it effectively.

                  <h4>What is CSS?</h4>
                  <p>
                    Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML. CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.
                    <br><br>
                    CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts.[3] This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics, enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content as well as enabling the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.

                  <p>
                    CSS is the language that I am most obsessed with.  I use a preprocessor of CSS, within my current role and have even provided training over some of the topics--to my team.

                  <h4>What is Javascript?</h4>
                  <p>
                    JavaScript often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification. JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm. It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.
                    <br><br>
                    Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web. Over 97% of websites use it client-side for web page behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries. All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on the user's device.
                    <br><br>
                    As a multi-paradigm language, JavaScript supports event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).

                    Vanilla JavaScript isnt' really something that I use too much.  Like many web developers, I make use of JQuery for most of my web functionality coding.
